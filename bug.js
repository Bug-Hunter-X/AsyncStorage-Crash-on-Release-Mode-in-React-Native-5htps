This React Native bug is related to the usage of AsyncStorage. Specifically, when trying to retrieve data from AsyncStorage, the application crashes without any clear error message. This usually occurs when the application is running in release mode or on a physical device. During development, the application often works without issue, making debugging difficult. The problem only surfaces after the app is compiled in release mode and installed on a device.
